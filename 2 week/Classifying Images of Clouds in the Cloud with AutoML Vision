What you learn
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Upload a labeled dataset to Cloud Storage and connect it to AutoML Vision with a CSV label file

- Train a model with AutoML Vision and evaluate its accuracy

- Generate predictions on your trained model

Task 1. Set up AutoML Vision
## Create a Cloud Storage bucket for your training data

`gsutil mb -p $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    -c regional    \
    -l us-central1 \
    gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/
`
## Enabled AutoML API 

Task 2. Upload training images to Cloud Storage
gsutil -m cp -r gs://cloud-training/automl-lab-clouds/* gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/
gsutil ls gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/

Task 3. Create an AutoML Vision training dataset
Run the following commands which:

- Copy the template file to your Cloud Shell instance

- Update the CSV with the files in your project

- Upload this file to your Cloud Storage bucket

- Show the bucket to confirm the data.csv file is present
`
gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/automl-lab-clouds/data.csv .
head --lines=10 data.csv
sed -i -e "s/placeholder/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/g" ./data.csv
head --lines=10 data.csv
gsutil cp ./data.csv gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/
gsutil ls gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID-vcm/
`

Task 4. Inspect the images

Task 5. Train your model
To train your clouds model, go to the Train tab and click Start training.
Enter a name for your model, or use the default auto-generated name.
Leave Cloud hosted selected and click Continue.
For the next step, type the value "8" into the Set your budget * box and check Deploy model to 1 node after training. 
This process (auto-deploy) will make your model immediately available for predictions after testing is complete.
Click Start training.

Task 6. Evaluate your model
After training is complete, select the Evaluate tab. Here you'll see information about Precision and Recall of the model. It should resemble the following:
