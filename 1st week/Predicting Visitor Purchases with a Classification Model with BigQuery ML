Again, you're predicting for a subset of users who returned to your website and purchased. 
Since you don't know the future at prediction time, you cannot say with certainty whether a new visitor comes back and purchases. 
The value of building a ML model is to get the probability of future purchase based on the data gleaned about their first session.

For classification problems in ML, you want to minimize the False Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they don't) and maximize the True Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they do).
This relationship is visualized with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve like the one shown here, where you try to maximize the area under the curve or AUC:
